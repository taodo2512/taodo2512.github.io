<p>Book Review: “Please Look After Mom” - Shin Kyung-sook
“How long has it been since you talked to your mother? What are your mother’s dreams? Did Mom like being in the kitchen?”</p>

<p>These questions cited from Korean literature named Please Look After Mom, a famous work of a woman writer - Shin Kyung-sook, have made me contemplate family sentiment. It is also the book that I have recently read and want to share with you in this .</p>

<p>Released in 2009, Please Look After Mom immediately received numerous glowing reviews from the public and critics in 19 countries, and quickly became a best-seller. This 323-page work revolves around a moving and poignant story of a Korean family’s search for their missing mother, namely Park So-nyo. She appears as a devoted mother who is very affectionate towards not only her small family but also other people around. One day, on the way to visit the elder son, she is separated from her husband due to the crowd at Seoul subway station. This situation is also the opening chapter of this book. During their finding journey, we can feel the sacrifice, pains and aspirations that Mom harbours within, together with the children’s longing for family love and fight against losses.</p>

<p>This novel has evoked a strong feeling of reproach in me as I am also a daughter living far away from the village. The wheel of life has swept me away from my dears. I can’t remember the last time I told my cherished Mom what happened to me as my words turn sullen whenever having conversations with her; I even curse or dismiss her reminders. Only after reading this book do I realize how neglectful I have been. Thanks to the author for giving me the chance to look at myself. I now spend more time listening to Mom’s stories, consoling Mom for her old dreams which were buried through pages of time. More often I say I love her, I am happy to have her in my life, and let her know she is one-of-a-kind.</p>

<p>To recap, told by the alternative voices of the daughter, the son, the husband, and the Mom herself; mingled between present and upstream memories, Please Look After Mom is not only a story about a Mom but also for all moms in general. It is the most touching maternal book that I’ve ever read, suitable for all ages, and surely makes you shed a tear.</p>
